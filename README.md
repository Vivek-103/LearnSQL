# SQL Learning Repository

Welcome to my SQL Learning Repository! This repository contains a collection of SQL queries and exercises that I am using to learn and practice SQL. The goal is to build a solid foundation in SQL by working through various problems and challenges, and to learn how to work with relational databases.

## 📚 Contents

1. **SQL Queries**
   - Various SQL queries demonstrating basic to advanced SQL concepts like filtering, aggregation, subqueries, joins, and data manipulation.
   - Examples include queries to find employees, clients, branch information, and more.

2. **Database Schema**
   - SQL scripts to create and populate tables with sample data, including employees, clients, branches, suppliers, and works_with data.

3. **Practice Problems**
   - A list of SQL tasks and exercises that I am solving to understand key concepts such as:
     - SELECT statements
     - Aggregation functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
     - Grouping and joining tables
     - Data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
     - Subqueries and nested queries

## 💡 Learning Objectives

- Understand and use SQL data types, constraints, and relationships.
- Master the use of SELECT statements to query data from one or more tables.
- Practice advanced SQL concepts such as subqueries, joins, and aggregations.
- Learn how to manipulate data using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands.
- Explore the use of aggregate functions and grouping data in SQL.
- Gain experience in building and managing relational database structures.

## 🛠 Technologies

- **SQL**: The primary language used to interact with relational databases.
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL**: Relational databases used for practicing SQL queries (may change depending on the environment).
